# Dheeraj — Portfolio (React + Vite)

This is a minimal React + Vite scaffold for a personal portfolio. Content is left as placeholders for you to fill in.

How to run.

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# start dev server
npm run dev

# build for production
npm run build

# preview build
npm run preview
```

Files added

- `index.html` — Vite entry (root div + module loader)
- `package.json` — scripts + dependencies
- `src/main.jsx` — app entry
- `src/App.jsx` — routes and container
- `src/components/NavBar.jsx` — top nav
- `src/pages/*` — Home, About, Experience, Achievements, Contact (placeholders)
- `src/index.css` — small, opinionated styles

Profile image

- Place your profile picture in the `public/` folder as `profile.jpg` (or `profile.png`). The app will use `/profile.jpg` if present. A placeholder `public/profile.svg` is included by default.


Next steps

- Fill your content in `src/pages/*` and update links in `NavBar.jsx`.
- Add images to `public/` and reference them from pages.
- Deploy using Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages. Vite builds a static site into `dist/`.
